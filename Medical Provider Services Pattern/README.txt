Medicare Clustering Analysis

This notebook presents a comprehensive clustering analysis of Medicare providers, focusing on grouping similar entities based on key characteristics. The primary objectives are to identify patterns in Medicare provider data and segment providers into meaningful clusters for further analysis.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparation of Medicare data, including handling missing values and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summary statistics to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Clustering Techniques: Implementation of various clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to identify optimal groupings.
Evaluation: Assessment of cluster quality using metrics like silhouette scores and visual inspection.
